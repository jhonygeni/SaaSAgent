# Evolution API v2 Authentication Validation Report

## ‚úÖ Authentication Test Summary

All endpoints have been tested and confirmed to work correctly with the `apikey` header format (not `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`).

**Test Date:** May 27, 2023  
**API URL:** https://cloudsaas.geni.chat  
**Authentication Format:** `apikey: TOKEN`

## üß™ Endpoint Test Results

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| API Info | GET | 200 OK | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Fetch Instances | GET | 200 OK | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Create Instance | POST | 201 Created | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Connect Instance | GET | 200 OK | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Connection State | GET | 200 OK | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Delete Instance | DELETE | 200 OK | ‚úÖ PASS |
| Invalid Authentication | GET | 401 Unauthorized | ‚úÖ PASS |

## üîë Authentication Details

The Evolution API v2 requires authentication with the `apikey` header format:

```javascript
// CORRECT AUTHENTICATION FORMAT
headers['apikey'] = EVOLUTION_API_KEY;

// INCORRECT AUTHENTICATION FORMAT (previously used)
// headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${EVOLUTION_API_KEY}`;
```

This change has been implemented across all API clients and confirmed working correctly.

## üöÄ Workflow Validation

The entire WhatsApp connection workflow has been tested and verified:

1. **Instance Creation:** Successfully creates a new instance
2. **QR Code Generation:** Successfully generates QR code for connection
3. **Connection State Check:** Successfully retrieves connection state
4. **Instance Deletion:** Successfully deletes the instance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Verification

The system correctly handles authentication errors when:
- Invalid API key is provided
- Key is missing
- Wrong header format is used

All cases correctly return `401 Unauthorized` status code.

## üîç Test Script

A test script has been created to verify the authentication and API endpoints:
`/Users/jhonymonhol/Desktop/conversa-ai-brasil/test-evolution-endpoints.mjs`

This script can be run in the future to verify that authentication is still working correctly.

## üìã Recommendations

1. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for 401/403 errors to detect authentication issues early
2. **Periodic Testing:** Run the test script periodically to ensure continued proper operation
3. **Documentation:** Keep all documentation updated with the correct authentication format
4. **Error Messages:** Ensure user-friendly error messages for authentication failures

## üèÅ Conclusion

The Evolution API v2 integration is now properly using `apikey` header authentication, and all endpoints have been verified to work correctly with this authentication format.
