3. `/Users/jhonymonhol/Desktop/conversa-ai-brasil/src/lib/api-throttle.ts`
   - New utility for throttling all API calls
   - Provides endpoint-specific and context-specific caching
   - Configurable intervals for different API endpoints
   - Prevents duplicate parallel calls to the same endpoint

4. `/Users/jhonymonhol/Desktop/conversa-ai-brasil/src/components/AgentChat.tsx`
   - Applied throttling to message history and pagination calls
   - Fixed real-time subscription handling with stable channel IDs
   - Added exponential backoff and max reconnection attempts
   - Prevented duplicate API calls when loading messages

## Implementation Details

### Comprehensive Throttling System

The enhanced throttling mechanism works by:

1. **Context-Specific Caching**:
   - Separate caches for different users and instances
   - Endpoint-specific cache management
   - Configurable cache durations per endpoint

2. **Promise-Based Request Deduplication**:
   - Prevents duplicate parallel calls to the same endpoint
   - Returns the same promise for in-flight requests
   - Automatically updates cache when requests complete

3. **Enhanced Real-time Subscription Management**:
   - Stable channel IDs to prevent duplicate subscriptions
   - Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Maximum reconnection attempts to prevent infinite loops

Example usage of the subscription throttling:
```typescript
// Raw function implementation
const rawCheckSubscriptionStatus = async () => {
  // API call logic to check subscription
};

// Apply throttling with user-specific context
const checkSubscriptionStatus = throttledSubscriptionCheck(
  rawCheckSubscriptionStatus,
  { userId: user?.id, interval: 5 * 60 * 1000 }
);
```

Example usage of the general API throttling:
```typescript
// Create a throttled version of the API call
const loadMessagesThrottled = throttleApiCall(
  async ({ instanceId }) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .select('*')
      .eq('instance_id', instanceId);
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  },
  'messages_load',
  { interval: 60000, logLabel: 'Messages History' }
);

// Use it in components
const data = await loadMessagesThrottled({ instanceId: agent.id });
```

### Real-time Subscription Optimization

The real-time subscription management now includes:

1. **Stable Channel IDs**: 
   - Using `messages-${agent.id}-stable` instead of timestamp-based IDs
   - Prevents creation of multiple channels for the same agent

2. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Gradually increases delay between reconnection attempts
   - Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, etc. up to 30s max

3. **Maximum Reconnection Attempts**:
   - Limits to 5 reconnection attempts to prevent infinite loops
   - Logs and reports connection status to user interface

### Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Open the browser developer tools (Network tab)
2. Navigate through the application and watch for API calls
3. Verify the following reductions:
   - `check-subscription` called at most once every 5 minutes per user
   - `/messages` endpoint called at most once every minute per instance
   - No repeated real-time subscription connections for the same agent
   - Only one channel per agent for real-time updates

## Monitoring and Performance Impact

The optimizations are expected to result in:

1. **Drastically Reduced API Calls**:
   - 95%+ reduction in subscription check calls
   - 80%+ reduction in message loading calls
   - Elimination of duplicate real-time subscriptions

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Lower backend load
   - Faster UI response times
   - Reduced risk of rate limiting
   - Decreased data transfer costs

3. **Enhanced Reliability**:
   - Proper error handling
   - Graceful reconnection logic
   - User feedback for connection status

## Further Improvements

Additional optimizations to consider implementing:

1. **Server-Side Optimizations**:
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates instead of REST polling
   - Add server-side rate limiting and request deduplication
   - Optimize database queries for message fetching

2. **Advanced Caching**:
   - Implement localStorage caching for offline support
   - Add cache invalidation triggers for important events
   - Consider using ServiceWorker for advanced caching

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**:
   - Add telemetry to track API call frequency
   - Implement circuit breakers for failing endpoints
   - Create dashboard to monitor system health
