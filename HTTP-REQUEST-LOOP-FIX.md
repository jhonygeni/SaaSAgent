# HTTP Request Loop Fix - Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **Infinite HTTP Request Loops**
   - Fixed excessive API calls to `/messages?select=*&instance_desc` and `check-subscription` endpoints
   - Implemented throttling mechanism for subscription status checks
   - Resolved circular dependencies in AgentChat.tsx

2. **Subscription Status Checking**
   - Added 5-minute cache for subscription status checks
   - Implemented proper throttling mechanism in `UserContext.tsx`
   - Prevented duplicate parallel API calls with Promise caching

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/jhonymonhol/Desktop/conversa-ai-brasil/src/context/UserContext.tsx`
   - Fixed duplicate import of `throttledSubscriptionCheck`
   - Created throttled implementation of checkSubscriptionStatus
   - Properly memoized the function with useCallback

2. `/Users/jhonymonhol/Desktop/conversa-ai-brasil/src/lib/subscription-throttle.ts`
   - Implements a caching and throttling system for API calls
   - Uses a 5-minute (300,000ms) minimum interval between API calls
   - Provides a cache reset function for when subscription changes

3. `/Users/jhonymonhol/Desktop/conversa-ai-brasil/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
   - Added import for throttling utility

## Implementation Details

### Throttling System

The throttling mechanism works by:
1. Caching the results of API calls for 5 minutes
2. Preventing duplicate parallel calls
3. Reusing Promise for in-flight requests
4. Properly tracking API call lifecycle

Example usage:
```typescript
// Raw function implementation
const rawCheckSubscriptionStatus = async () => {
  // API call logic
};

// Apply throttling
const checkSubscriptionStatus = throttledSubscriptionCheck(rawCheckSubscriptionStatus);
```

### Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open the browser developer tools (Network tab)
2. Navigate through the application and watch for API calls
3. Verify that `check-subscription` is called at most once every 5 minutes
4. Verify that no infinite loops of API calls occur

## Further Improvements

Consider additional optimizations:
1. Apply throttling to any other frequent API calls
2. Review and optimize real-time subscriptions in other components
3. Add more detailed logging to track API call frequency
4. Consider implementing a global API rate limiter for all endpoints
