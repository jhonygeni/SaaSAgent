🔧 INFINITE LOOP FIX - QUICK SUMMARY

## CRITICAL BUG FIXED:
❌ BEFORE: `connectionStatus` in useCallback dependencies caused function recreation
✅ AFTER: Removed `connectionStatus` from dependencies - prevents multiple polling instances

## KEY SAFETY MECHANISMS ADDED:
1. 🛡️ **Absolute Timeout**: Force stop after 2 minutes regardless of bugs
2. 🚫 **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple polling instances  
3. 🧹 **Robust Cleanup**: Enhanced clearPolling with proper lifecycle
4. 📊 **Better Logging**: Track polling start/stop for debugging
5. ⏰ **Multiple Stop Conditions**: Max attempts + max time + success detection

## TEST RESULTS:
✅ Polling stops on success (QR scan)
✅ Polling stops after 20 attempts (40s)  
✅ Polling force-stops after 2 minutes
✅ No multiple polling instances
✅ Proper cleanup and logging

## MONITORING:
Watch for: "🛑 STOPPING POLLING IMMEDIATELY" in logs
If polling continues > 2 minutes = investigate further

## FILES CHANGED:
- src/hooks/whatsapp/useWhatsAppStatus.ts (main fix)

The infinite loop should now be completely resolved! 🎉
